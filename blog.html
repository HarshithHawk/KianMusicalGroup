	<h2 class="h3">Self-reliant</h3>
	<p>I sometimes feel, and I believe that I’ve felt a huge magnitude of stress in my life, but never complaint to god. Instead, I’ve always prayed to god for the tolerance. </p>
	<p>
		I’ve always tried to give my family something better but of no use. Money only fulfills your daily requirements and it doesn’t unite family. People started believing I’m broke. After a lot of suffering and patience, I decided: I’m also human. I also have the exact same hands and legs, the exact same innovative and fully functional brain like the other people. The man inside me suddenly woke up. Now I won’t listen to anybody. Now I’ll do whatever my inner me wants me to do. After all how long I will listen to other people, how long I’ll do what they want me to do. I’ve got the exact same creative brain like everyone else. I’ve always read about the innovative people that how they live their lives to the fullest. They have all the money, all the happiness in their lives they wanted. Because they do what they wanted to do with their lives.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now my eyes are open, I’ll only do the things I want to do without any fear, tension and without following anyone. I’ll just enjoy the creative work they have done.
If you want to live your life, become childlike. You will live happily, without any fear.
	</p>
	<p>
		I care for the people, because I’m close to them but many of them have hurt me. They might be jealous of me or my way of living life. I am who I am, living my life joyfully and I don’t care.
	</p>
	<p>
		Love is important and I’ve something greater than love, the so-called passion and I can go to the extremities, but who understands love? I sometimes cry in alone place. I feel nostalgic when I recall the memory of my friends but after all I’m lonely. I’ve no friends.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a long time I away from my art but still is I have that artist alive in me, that same kid is alive yet.
It’s the matter of time. My heart is restless cos of love. I’m craving for love. I cannot withstand the fact I’m lonely.
	</p>
	<p>
		I love people and I want that they don’t suffer from what I passed in my life. Other people won’t b having too much patience like me. 
So now if I want to live life ahead then only with self-pride. Otherwise what is the meaning of life? Whole world is living but we are unique. Life has given something different to us. Using which we can lead a better way, a better life.
	</p>
	<p>
		Music and motivation are the boon to humanity which gives us the moral support we require. It creates happiness and positivity. We just get immersed in it not knowing whether we are singing or dancing, we just forget our pain. As if we are close to nature enjoying the flora and fauna and the environment suddenly changes. God made us for a purpose. We must keep interest in nature. We all have to listen to the whole world and nature.
	</p>
	<p>
		Do whatever you like. Make a bigger house, a luxury car, and a comfortable life but don’t just play with nature. Nature preserves the environment around us joyful and worth living. So that from this bring out innocent child out of you and can again rejoice life.
	</p>
	<p>
		It’s my job to wake you up from your fantasies. That’s what I’m doing. If you don’t want to wake up, I don’t care but your next generation will not know what it is to live life in the first place. What are feelings and what is pain? What is loneliness?  After-all loving other people is necessary, else we are all robots in the world of constantly evolving technology. We may vanish from earth like dinosaurs and there will be no human left on earth. Maybe only robots stays. If you hinder the works of almighty Bharmha, Vishnu and Mahesh, they will change their existing form and there might be no almighty then. This might make a generation gap in heaven and hell.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not in our hands to be born but it is in our hands how to live our lives. How to nurture our only life is in our hands. More people suicide, children’s are getting depressed because they have no moral support. Now-a-days nobody has time for their family, their kids, even their parents. Lastly the time shows everything and the zillionaires take away everything. They do stuff which we can’t even imagine. Unique people, one can become Mark Zuckerburg who is millionaire who enjoy being one. They have such creativity which we cannot think also before. After waking up in morning Mukesh Ambani goes at their office with some innocent plan coz he is creative and unique.

	<p>
		Thank you.
